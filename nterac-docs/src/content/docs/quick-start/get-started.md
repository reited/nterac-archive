## About
nterac is an HTTP API server module for Deno. It uses file-system based routing.

### Goals
nterac aims to be simple, understandable, might as well beginner-friendly.

As this project aims for simplicity, it is fast to work with. You, the developer only needs to clone a template, and you can start coding right away.

It also aims to be relatively fast. Using Deno, it's faster than node, but might not be fastest.

### Logo and name
The logo, aside that it's just two disk, represents the Saturn.  
The name comes from 'interact', leaving out the i and t, as a plus pun.
