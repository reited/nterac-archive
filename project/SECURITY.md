## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report, send an email to [all@kallasz.tk](mailto:all@kallasz.tk).  
You can also report using Github's Private vulnerability reporting option.

Please write clearly and descriptively. It is a good practice if you also include something like 'security issue report' in the subject.
